Customizing Chef Examples
================

This repository contains the code examples that complement my book, [Customizing Chef](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920032984.do).

Usage
------

The examples in this repository are structured according to their locations and directory structure as described by the book. Where the material in the book requires a file to be progressively added to, I've included the file multiple times with a numerical suffix such as ```example3-2.rb``` instead of ```example3.rb```.

You should refer to the relevant chapters of the book for instructions on how to run each example.


Prerequisites
-------------
As Chef is supported on a number of different platforms, these examples make several assumptions about the environment in which you’re running Chef in order to keep them as readable and simple as possible. I assume that:

* You’re running on a Linux/Unix-based operating system (this includes Mac OS X).
* You’re running at least chef-client version 11.10.0.
* You have at least version 1.9.2 of Ruby installed — many of the examples in this book will not work with Ruby 1.8.
* You have the Git source code management system installed.
* You’re familiar with the use of a programmer’s text editor such as Vim, Emacs, or TextMate.

Using Code Examples
-------------------

The following paragraphs replicate the section of the preface which deals with using the code examples contained in [Customizing Chef](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920032984.do), of which this repository contains digital copies.

This book is here to help you get your job done. In general, if example code is offered with this book, you may use it in your programs and documentation. You do not need to contact us for permission unless you’re reproducing a significant portion of the code. For example, writing a program that uses several chunks of code from this book does not require permission. Selling or distributing a CD-ROM of examples from O’Reilly books does require permission. Answering a question by citing this book and quoting example code does not require permission. Incorporating a significant amount of example code from this book into your product’s documentation does require permission.

We appreciate, but do not require, attribution. An attribution usually includes the title, author, publisher, and ISBN. For example:
